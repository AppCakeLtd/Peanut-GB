# Contributing

Please contribute. Before you make a pull request though, please consider the
following:

- Commit messages must be clear. No "minor fix" or "oopsie woopsie uwu".
- Code style must be consistent. Use `astyle` with the .astylerc file provided
  within this repo to format your changes.
- Each commit should fix only one thing. Editing a README should all be in one
  commit, but adding CGB and fixing Tetris should be in separate commits.

If you aren't sure, make the pull request and I'll happily review the changes
made. :smiley:
